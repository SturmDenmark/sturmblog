In this blog post I'm following [@networkchuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) on the journey for creating a automated blog post submitter. I got inspired after watching his youtube and now I'm looking into buying the book :astonished:

The site is build using Hugo and I'm using the Hermit-V2 theme.

This is a journey for me, where I'm trying to grow. Taking some of all of the ideas in my head and put them to writing. How knows, maybe even realizing some of these ideas into the physical world :hugs:

But as every journey, it start's with a step, and this is the first one for me.
